# isort
Highly specific image sorting gui. Probably not very useful for anyone else than Toke Eskildsen.

## Purpose
Fast sorting (aka categorization or selection) of images to different destinations.

## Background
I take multiple photos each day. Often there are multiple photos of the same subject. The photos are to be sorted to multiple destinations, with the primary one being "the best" photos. Using a standard file browser or image album software has been tried and works so-so.
